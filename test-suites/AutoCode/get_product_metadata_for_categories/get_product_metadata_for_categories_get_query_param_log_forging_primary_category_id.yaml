description: "This call retrieves an array of all supported aspects, aspect constraints,\
  \ and aspect values for the specified eBay categories. The array is a union (with\
  \ duplicates removed) of all returned aspects.Note: This call is currently supported\
  \ only in the eBay Sandbox environment (https://api.sandbox.ebay.com). After using\
  \ the search and getProduct calls to find a catalog product that matches a seller's\
  \ inventory item, you may determine that a matching product does not exist in the\
  \ eBay catalog. You can propose a new product for the catalog by taking the following\
  \ steps: Use the Taxonomy API's category_tree calls to discover the appropriate\
  \ category or categories for the seller's inventory item. See Finding categories\
  \ for a listing or promotion. Use getProductMetadataForCategories to determine the\
  \ aspects of your selected categories that should be associated with your new product.\
  \ Use the createChangeRequest call to to submit a change request to add the new\
  \ product to the eBay catalog for your seller's marketplace.Note: The X-EBAY-C-MARKETPLACE-ID\
  \ request header is required to identify the user's business context. At least one\
  \ eBay category ID is required and is specified through the primary_category_id\
  \ query parameter."
