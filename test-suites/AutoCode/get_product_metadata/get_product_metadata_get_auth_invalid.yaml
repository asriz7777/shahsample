description: "This call retrieves an array of all supported aspects, aspect constraints,\
  \ and aspect values for the specified catalog product and its associated or suggested\
  \ categories, as well as the values currently associated with that product. The\
  \ array is a union (with duplicates removed) of all returned aspects.Note: This\
  \ call is currently supported only in the eBay Sandbox environment (https://api.sandbox.ebay.com).\
  \ After using the search and getProduct calls to find a catalog product that matches\
  \ a seller's inventory item, you may discover a matching product, but determine\
  \ that one or more product details are missing or inaccurate. You can propose updates\
  \ to the product's aspects and aspect values for the catalog by taking the following\
  \ steps: Use the Taxonomy API's category_tree calls to discover the appropriate\
  \ category or categories for the seller's inventory item. See Finding categories\
  \ for a listing or promotion. Use getProductMetadata to determine the aspects of\
  \ your selected categories and the values of those aspects that should be added\
  \ to the aspects and values already associated with your product. Use the createChangeRequest\
  \ call to to submit a change request to update the product in the eBay catalog for\
  \ your seller's marketplace.Note: The X-EBAY-C-MARKETPLACE-ID request header is\
  \ required to identify the user's business context. The eBay Product Identifier\
  \ (ePID) for a catalog product is also required and is specified through the epid\
  \ query parameter."
